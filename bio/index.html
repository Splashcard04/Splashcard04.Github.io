            Hello! I'm Splashcard. I'm a student dev and musician. I enjoy coding in many languages including HTML, CSS, JS, Python, C# and more. <br> <br>
            I also love to play the trumpet in marching bands, concert bands and jazz bands. I play other instruments too including guitar and a little bit of piano. <br> <br>
            Im a big fan of the artists Jake Hill, Josh A and others. <br><br>
            I also love the outdoors; Camping, hiking, and fishing are some of my favorite activities. <br><br>
            Thanks for visiting my site! <br><br><br><br><br>
